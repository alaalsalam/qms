### Queue Management System

The Queue Management System (QMS) is an application built on the Frappe framework that helps manage queues in various departments. It allows real-time updates for users as well as plays an audio file whenever a queue is called, ensuring smooth queue management and enhancing user experience. The system displays the list of queues in each day and for each department and provides a real-time update on the screen. 

#### Key Features:
- **Real-time updates** for all users across the system.
- **Queue management** for each department, displaying queues in real-time.
- **Audio notifications** that play whenever a queue is called.
- **Instant updates on screen** to show the latest changes without delay.
